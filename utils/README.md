This directory contains a collection of utility programs, mostly written in Python (3).
They're intended to be invoked from the command-line, but the core operations are exposed
as functions that can be imported by other programs.

Program             | Description
--------------------|-------------
`ef-env.py`         | Populates environment variables from the parameters and outputs of a CloudFormation stack.

Each program is documented fully in its header.
