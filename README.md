Grab-bag of utilities and other stuff that I use with AWS. Easier to keep track of as a project rather than lots of gists.

## Lambdas

## Terraform

[users-and-groups](terraform/users-and-groups)                      | Example of table-driven generation of users, groups, and group permissions.


## Command-line utilities

Each is documented in its header, and exposes functions that may be useful for other programs.

Note: to run you must have `boto3` installed.

Program                                                             | Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------
[cf-env.py](utils/cf-env.py)                                        | Populates environment variables from the parameters and outputs of a CloudFormation stack.
[assume-role.py](utils/assume-role.py)                              | Spawns a subshell with authentication credentials for a specified role.

In addition, I have a collection of command-line snippets [here](cli.md).
